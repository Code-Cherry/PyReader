# PyReader
PyReader is a Visual Studio Code extension that specializes in increasing accessibility for Blind and Visually Impaired programmers using Python.

## Prior to Use
To use PyReader, ensure that both **Python** and **Node.JS** are installed on your machine. Ensure that you run `npm install` in a PowerShell console to update and install all Node.JS packages, which are required to run Visual Studio Code extensions.

## Use Instructions
1. Download **PyReader** on the Visual Studio Code Extension Store. If you are a **beta tester**, find the appropriate vsix file for your operating system and consult [this link](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Installing-Beta-Releases) for further instructions.
2. Ensure that Python file of choice is open and focused in the VS Code IDE.
3. Run the command "PyReader" from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` by default).
4. An HTML outline file should automatically open in the VS Code IDE.
5. If desired, select a line in the HTML outline to **automatically jump to that declaration** in the original program.
